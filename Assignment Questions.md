## Interview Readiness:
- What is the definition of a serverless application?

	- Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development. A cloud provider handles the routine work of provisioning, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure. Developers can simply package their code in containers for deployment. Once deployed, serverless apps respond to demand and automatically scale up and down as needed. Serverless offerings from public cloud providers are usually metered on-demand through an event-driven execution model. As a result, when a serverless function is sitting idle, it doesn’t cost anything.
	
- What is the definition of model serving and what are the two types?	
	- Model serving is to host ML models (on the cloud or on premises) and to make their functions available via API so that applications can incorporate AI into their systems.

- What are 3 advantages of deploying using Model Serving methods Vs. deploying on GitHub Pages or HuggingFace for free?


- What Is Machine Learning Inference? How Does Machine Learning Inference Work? Please walk us through an example?
	- The process of putting new data points automatically through a deployed ML app to make predictions is called machine learning inference. This process is also referred to as “operationalizing an ML model” or “putting an ML model into production.”
	- A computer vision example can be a model trained to detect rotten tomato from ripe/healthy tomato. After we train the model, we can put it into production to make prediction on new photos of tomatoes.
